	abstract = {The oxidation and corrosion of metals are fundamental problems in materials science and technology that have been studied using a large variety of experimental and computational techniques. Here we review some of the recent studies that have led to signi铿乧ant advances in our atomic-level understanding of copper oxide, one of the most studied and best understood metal oxides. We show that a good atomistic understanding of the physical characteristics of cuprous (Cu2O) and cupric (CuO) oxide and of some key processes of their formation has been obtained. Indeed, the growth of the oxide has been shown to be epitaxial with the surface and to proceed, in most cases, through the formation of oxide nano-islands which, with continuous oxygen exposure, grow and eventually coalesce. We also show how electronic structure calculations have become increasingly useful in helping to characterise the structures and energetics of various Cu oxide surfaces. However a number of challenges remain. For example, it is not clear under which conditions the oxidation of copper in air at room temperature (known as native oxidation) leads to the formation of a cuprous oxide 铿乴m only, or also of a cupric overlayer. Moreover, the atomistic details of the nucleation of the oxide islands are still unknown. We close our review with a brief perspective on future work and discuss how recent advances in experimental techniques, bringing greater temporal and spatial resolution, along with improvements in the accuracy, realism and timescales achievable with computational approaches make it possible for these questions to be answered in the near future.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics modeling has provided a powerful tool for simulating and understanding diverse systems – ranging from materials processes to biophysical phenomena. Parallel formulations of these methods have been shown to be among the most scalable scientific computing applications. Many instances of this class of methods rely on a static bond structure for molecules, rendering them infeasible for reactive systems. Recent work on reactive force fields has resulted in the development of ReaxFF, a novel bond order potential that bridges quantum-scale and classical MD approaches by explicitly modeling bond activity (reactions) and charge equilibration. These aspects of ReaxFF pose significant challenges from a computational standpoint, both in sequential and parallel contexts. Evolving bond structure requires efficient dynamic data structures. Minimizing electrostatic energy through charge equilibration requires the solution of a large sparse linear system with a shielded electrostatic kernel at each sub-femtosecond long time-step. In this context, reaching spatio-temporal scales of tens of nanometers and nanoseconds, where phenomena of interest can be observed, poses significant challenges. In this paper, we present the design and implementation details of the Purdue Reactive Molecular Dynamics code, PuReMD. PuReMD has been demonstrated to be highly efficient (in terms of processor performance) and scalable. It extends current spatio-temporal simulation capability for reactive atomistic systems by over an order of magnitude. It incorporates efficient dynamic data structures, algorithmic optimizations, and effective solvers to deliver low per-time-step simulation time, with a small memory footprint. PuReMD is comprehensively validated for performance and accuracy on up to 3375 cores on a commodity cluster (Hera at LLNL-OCF). Potential performance bottlenecks to scalability beyond our experiments have also been analyzed. PuReMD is available over the public domain and has been used to model diverse systems, ranging from strain relaxation in Si–Ge nanobars, water–silica surface interaction, and oxidative stress in lipid bilayers (bio-membranes).},

In addition, we developed an algorithm to search the transition state (TS) of elementary steps, which is the ﬁrst TS searching program based on the ReaxFF theory framework, and a new algorithm is proposed to create reaction paths and coordinate scans with highdegrees of freedom. The comparison of results of DFT and ReaxFF indicate that the developed force ﬁeld is capable of describing the properties related to reactive interactions between the Cu metal and C/H/O molecules. To test this developed Cu/C/H/O force ﬁeld, a series of molecular dynamics simulations were performed. In Cu/C/H/O surface simulation, elementary C/H/O reactions involving H transfer and H2/CHO dissociations were observed supporting the complex C/H/O interactions on a Cu surface. In addition, two Cu/CHO example cases relevant to the chemical looping combustion process were also simulated: metal oxide (CuO) generation from reactions of metallic Cu with glucose and hydrocarbon fuel oxidation using a copper oxide as the oxidizer. Our simulation results indicate that the current Cu/C/H/O ReaxFF is able to capture the reaction details and distinguish the redox performances of diﬀerent fuels.},

We present an eﬃcient approach for optimizing the weight parameters of the neural network via multistream Kalman ﬁltering, using potential energies and forces as reference data. In this procedure, the choice of the free parameters of the Kalman ﬁlter can have a signiﬁcant impact on the ﬁt quality. Carrying out a large parameter study, we determine optimal settings and demonstrate how to optimize training results of HDNNPs. Moreover, we illustrate our HDNNP training approach by revisiting previously presented ﬁts for water and developing a new potential for copper sulﬁde. This material, accessible in computer simulations so far only via ﬁrst-principles methods, forms a particularly complex solid structure at low temperatures and undergoes a phase transition to a superionic state upon heating. Analyzing MD simulations carried out with the Cu2S HDNNP, we conﬁrm that the underlying ab initio reference method indeed reproduces this behavior.},

	abstract = {Highly accurate potential energy surfaces are of key interest for the detailed understanding and predictive modeling of chemical systems. In recent years, several new types of force fields, which are based on machine learning algorithms and fitted to ab initio reference calculations, have been introduced to meet this requirement. Here, we show how high-dimensional neural network potentials can be employed to automatically generate the potential energy surface of finite sized clusters at coupled cluster accuracy, namely CCSD(T*)-F12a/aug-cc-pVTZ. The developed automated procedure utilizes the established intrinsic properties of the model such that the configurations for the training set are selected in an unbiased and efficient way to minimize the computational effort of expensive reference calculations. These ideas are applied to protonated water clusters from the hydronium cation, H3O+, up to the tetramer, H9O4+, and lead to a single potential energy surface that describes all these systems at essentially converged coupled cluster accuracy with a fitting error of 0.06 kJ/mol per atom. The fit is validated in detail for all clusters up to the tetramer and yields reliable results not only for stationary points but also for reaction pathways and intermediate configurations as well as different sampling techniques. Per design, the neural network potentials (NNPs) constructed in this fashion can handle very different conditions including the quantum nature of the nuclei and enhanced sampling techniques covering very low as well as high temperatures. This enables fast and exhaustive exploration of the targeted protonated water clusters with essentially converged interactions. In addition, the automated process will allow one to tackle finite systems much beyond the present case.},

	abstract = {A new method is presented to identify the truly interfacial molecules at fluid/fluid interfaces seen at molecular resolution, a situation that regularly occurs in computer simulations. In the new method, the surface is scanned by moving a probe sphere of a given radius along a large set of test lines that are perpendicular to the plane of the interface. The molecules that are hit by the probe spheres are regarded as interfacial ones, and the position of the test spheres when they are in contact with the interfacial molecules give an estimate of the surface. The dependence of the method on various parameters, in particular, on the size of the probe sphere is discussed in detail. Based on the list of molecules identified as truly interfacial ones, two measures of the molecular scale roughness of the surface are proposed. The bivariate distribution of the lateral and normal distances of two points of the interface provides a full description of the molecular scale morphology of the surface in a statistical sense. For practical purposes two parameters related to the dependence of the average normal distance of two surface points on their lateral distance can be used. These two parameters correspond to the frequency and amplitude of the surface roughness, respectively. The new method is applied for the analysis of the molecular level structure of the liquid–vapor interface of water. As an immediate result of the application of the new method it is shown that the orientational preferences of the interfacial water molecules depend only on the local curvature of the interface, and hence the molecules located at wells of concave curvature of the rippled surface prefer the same orientations as waters located at the surface of small apolar solutes. The vast majority of the truly interfacial molecules are found to form a strongly percolating two-dimensional hydrogen bonded network at the surface, whereas no percolation is observed within the second molecular layer beyond the surface. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

B 28, 784 (1983) https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.28.784.] has become a standard tool in condensed matter physics, with applications including glass, jamming, melting or crystallization transitions, and cluster formation. Here, we discuss two fundamental flaws in the definition of these parameters that significantly affect their interpretation for studies of disordered systems, and offer a remedy. First, the definition of the bond-orientational order parameters considers the geometrical arrangement of a set of nearest neighboring (NN) spheres, NN(p), around a given central particle p; we show that the choice of neighborhood definition can have a bigger influence on both the numerical values and qualitative trend of ql than a change of the physical parameters, such as packing fraction. Second, the discrete nature of neighborhood implies that NN(p) is not a continuous function of the particle coordinates; this discontinuity, inherited by ql, leads to a lack of robustness of the ql as structure metrics. Both issues can be avoided by a morphometric approach leading to the robust Minkowski structure metrics ql. These ql are of a similar mathematical form as the conventional bond-orientational order parameters and are mathematically equivalent to the recently introduced Minkowski tensors [G. E.

	abstract = {Bond-orientational order in molecular-dynamics simulations of supercooled liquids and in models of metallic glasses is studied. Quadratic and third-order invariants formed from bond spherical harmonics allow quantitative measures of cluster symmetries in these systems. A state with short-range translational order, but extended correlations in the orientations of particle clusters, starts to develop about 10\% below the equilibrium melting temperature in a supercooled Lennard-Jones liquid. The order is predominantly icosahedral, although there is also a cubic component which we attribute to the periodic boundary conditions. Results are obtained for liquids cooled in an icosahedral pair potential as well. Only a modest amount of orientational order appears in a relaxed Finney dense-random-packing model. In contrast, we find essentially perfect icosahedral bond correlations in alternative "amorphon" cluster models of glass structure.},
