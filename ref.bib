	abstract = {The oxidation and corrosion of metals are fundamental problems in materials science and technology that have been studied using a large variety of experimental and computational techniques. Here we review some of the recent studies that have led to signi铿乧ant advances in our atomic-level understanding of copper oxide, one of the most studied and best understood metal oxides. We show that a good atomistic understanding of the physical characteristics of cuprous (Cu2O) and cupric (CuO) oxide and of some key processes of their formation has been obtained. Indeed, the growth of the oxide has been shown to be epitaxial with the surface and to proceed, in most cases, through the formation of oxide nano-islands which, with continuous oxygen exposure, grow and eventually coalesce. We also show how electronic structure calculations have become increasingly useful in helping to characterise the structures and energetics of various Cu oxide surfaces. However a number of challenges remain. For example, it is not clear under which conditions the oxidation of copper in air at room temperature (known as native oxidation) leads to the formation of a cuprous oxide 铿乴m only, or also of a cupric overlayer. Moreover, the atomistic details of the nucleation of the oxide islands are still unknown. We close our review with a brief perspective on future work and discuss how recent advances in experimental techniques, bringing greater temporal and spatial resolution, along with improvements in the accuracy, realism and timescales achievable with computational approaches make it possible for these questions to be answered in the near future.},

We will discuss: (a) partial occupancies within the framework of the linear tetrahedron method and the finite temperature density-functional theory, (b) iterative methods for the diagonalization of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian and a discussion of an efficient iterative method based on the ideas of Pulay's residual minimization, which is close to an order Natoms2 scaling even for relatively large systems, (c) efficient Broyden-like and Pulay-like mixing methods for the charge density including a new special ‘preconditioning’ optimized for a plane-wave basis set, (d) conjugate gradient methods for minimizing the electronic free energy with respect to all degrees of freedom simultaneously. We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VAMP (Vienna ab-initio molecular-dynamics package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semi-conducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable."

Due to their low computational cost, such representations open the possibility for large scale reactive molecular dynamics simulations of processes with bonding situations that cannot be described accurately with traditional empirical force fields. Here, we present a library of functions developed for the implementation of neural network potentials. Written in C++, this library incorporates several strategies resulting in a very high efficiency of neural network potential-energy and force evaluations. Based on this library, we have developed an implementation of the neural network potential within the molecular dynamics package LAMMPS and demonstrate its performance using liquid water as a test system.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics modeling has provided a powerful tool for simulating and understanding diverse systems – ranging from materials processes to biophysical phenomena. Parallel formulations of these methods have been shown to be among the most scalable scientific computing applications. Many instances of this class of methods rely on a static bond structure for molecules, rendering them infeasible for reactive systems. Recent work on reactive force fields has resulted in the development of ReaxFF, a novel bond order potential that bridges quantum-scale and classical MD approaches by explicitly modeling bond activity (reactions) and charge equilibration. These aspects of ReaxFF pose significant challenges from a computational standpoint, both in sequential and parallel contexts. Evolving bond structure requires efficient dynamic data structures. Minimizing electrostatic energy through charge equilibration requires the solution of a large sparse linear system with a shielded electrostatic kernel at each sub-femtosecond long time-step. In this context, reaching spatio-temporal scales of tens of nanometers and nanoseconds, where phenomena of interest can be observed, poses significant challenges. In this paper, we present the design and implementation details of the Purdue Reactive Molecular Dynamics code, PuReMD. PuReMD has been demonstrated to be highly efficient (in terms of processor performance) and scalable. It extends current spatio-temporal simulation capability for reactive atomistic systems by over an order of magnitude. It incorporates efficient dynamic data structures, algorithmic optimizations, and effective solvers to deliver low per-time-step simulation time, with a small memory footprint. PuReMD is comprehensively validated for performance and accuracy on up to 3375 cores on a commodity cluster (Hera at LLNL-OCF). Potential performance bottlenecks to scalability beyond our experiments have also been analyzed. PuReMD is available over the public domain and has been used to model diverse systems, ranging from strain relaxation in Si–Ge nanobars, water–silica surface interaction, and oxidative stress in lipid bilayers (bio-membranes).},

	abstract = {A fully interactive Cu/C/H/O reactive force ﬁeld (ReaxFF) was developed for the Cu-metal surface catalysis system following three steps: (1) re-optimization of the Cu force ﬁeld by an extended training set including additional Cu cluster properties, (2) combination of this re-optimized Cu force ﬁeld and an existing C/H/O force ﬁeld, and (3) ﬁtting of interactions between Cu and C/H/O with extensive DFT data involving the various binding energies and elementary reaction steps. In addition, we developed an algorithm to search the transition state (TS) of elementary steps, which is the ﬁrst TS searching program based on the ReaxFF theory framework, and a new algorithm is proposed to create reaction paths and coordinate scans with highdegrees of freedom. The comparison of results of DFT and ReaxFF indicate that the developed force ﬁeld is capable of describing the properties related to reactive interactions between the Cu metal and C/H/O molecules. To test this developed Cu/C/H/O force ﬁeld, a series of molecular dynamics simulations were performed. In Cu/C/H/O surface simulation, elementary C/H/O reactions involving H transfer and H2/CHO dissociations were observed supporting the complex C/H/O interactions on a Cu surface. In addition, two Cu/CHO example cases relevant to the chemical looping combustion process were also simulated: metal oxide (CuO) generation from reactions of metallic Cu with glucose and hydrocarbon fuel oxidation using a copper oxide as the oxidizer. Our simulation results indicate that the current Cu/C/H/O ReaxFF is able to capture the reaction details and distinguish the redox performances of diﬀerent fuels.},

Here, we focus on the training of the neural networks that lies at the heart of the HDNNP method. We present an eﬃcient approach for optimizing the weight parameters of the neural network via multistream Kalman ﬁltering, using potential energies and forces as reference data. In this procedure, the choice of the free parameters of the Kalman ﬁlter can have a signiﬁcant impact on the ﬁt quality. Carrying out a large parameter study, we determine optimal settings and demonstrate how to optimize training results of HDNNPs. Moreover, we illustrate our HDNNP training approach by revisiting previously presented ﬁts for water and developing a new potential for copper sulﬁde. This material, accessible in computer simulations so far only via ﬁrst-principles methods, forms a particularly complex solid structure at low temperatures and undergoes a phase transition to a superionic state upon heating. Analyzing MD simulations carried out with the Cu2S HDNNP, we conﬁrm that the underlying ab initio reference method indeed reproduces this behavior.},
